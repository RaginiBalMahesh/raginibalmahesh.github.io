## About

I am a doctoral researcher at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in the Institute of Microwave and Radar under the supervision of Dr. Ronny Hänsch. 

My research interest includes satellite computer vision for earth observation and driving the current innovation of physics-informed, hybrid deep learning models. My Ph.D. topic is ”DeepSAR: The fusion of deep learning and physical models for extracting biophysical parameters (Forest Height) from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for earth observation”.
