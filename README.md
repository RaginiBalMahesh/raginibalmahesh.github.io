## About

My research interest includes satellite computer vision for earth observation and driving the current innovation of physics-informed, hybrid deep learning models. My Ph.D. topic is ”DeepSAR: The fusion of deep learning and physical models for extracting biophysical parameters (Forest Height) from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for earth observation”.
