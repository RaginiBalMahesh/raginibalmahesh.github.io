## About

I am a doctoral researcher at the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/en), in the [Department SAR Technology, Microwave and Radar Institute](https://www.dlr.de/hr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-2326/), under the supervision of [Dr. Ronny Hänsch](http://www.rhaensch.de/). 

My research interest includes satellite computer vision for earth observation and driving the current innovation of physics-informed, hybrid deep learning models. My Ph.D. topic is ”DeepSAR: The fusion of deep learning and physical models for extracting biophysical parameters (Forest Height) from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for earth observation”.

I graduated with a Master of Science (MSc.) from the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/), majoring in Computational Fluid Dynamics and a minor in Environmental Engineering, with a thesis on Physics Informed Neural Network for Spatial-Temporal Flood Forecasting (grade 1/1). I have worked as an AI Researcher at [NASA- SETI Frontier Development Lab](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/fdl-2022), an AI research accelerator. Winner of the [Water-Food-Energy Nexus Hackathon](http://www.ulliwaltinger.de/panel-nexus-hackathon-water-food-energy-nexus-sustainable-urban-development-munich-28th-august-2019/) at TUM (2019) for Implementing an LSTM model to forecast flood in a Bavarian river based on water level time-series data.
