## About

I am a doctoral researcher at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in the Institute of Microwave and Radar under the supervision of [Dr. Ronny Hänsch](http://www.rhaensch.de/). 

My research interest includes satellite computer vision for earth observation and driving the current innovation of physics-informed, hybrid deep learning models. My Ph.D. topic is ”DeepSAR: The fusion of deep learning and physical models for extracting biophysical parameters (Forest Height) from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for earth observation”.
